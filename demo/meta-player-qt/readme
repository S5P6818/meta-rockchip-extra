Machine: RK3288,RK3036
DISTRO: rk-none
IMAGE: qt5-image

Bottom video layer + transparent qt UI.
For video playback application.

The kernel patches should be modified if you don't use it with RK3288,RK3036.

### performance

##### UI
UI performance might be not good enough, especially the SoC like rk3036 which use a energy efficient ARM-core.
It's because our carmachine demo app have use too much QWidget. QWidget's contents are rendered using the CPU into images
(x11, qt-eglfs), then uploaded into textures(qt eglfs), which lead a bad perofmrance, especially with qt eglfs plugin.

Please use QQuickView/QQuickWindow for your application --- qt5everywheredemo is a good example.

##### Video
Video playback is done by gstreamer, you can do profiling via gst-luanch command. 

### 2018.1.20 Updates:

    - UI upscaling support
        now qt can run with 1080UI in a 4K screen.
        ENV: QT_QPA_EGLFS_WIDTH, QT_QPA_EGLFS_HEIGHT.  
        See patche/0001-eglfs_kms-allow-framebuffer-upscale.patch and autostart-rk3036.sh.

    - No Need for kernel swap-layer patches.
        Those pathes were kept now just to indicate how it works, it could be removed if you 
        want other application work in same kernel.
        After removed swap-layer patches, we should do two changes.
    
        1.Remove this line to let kmssink use primary plane.
        https://github.com/rockchip-linux/gstreamer-rockchip-extra/blob/master/gst/kms/gstkmssink.c#L536

        2.Apply below patches to qtbase to let qt use overlay-plane.
